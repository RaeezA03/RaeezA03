## A. Persoanl Introduction

My name is Raeez Ahmed, I am currently completing my Honors in Computer Science at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), with a strong foundation in physics and mathematics. I am disciplined and consistent, and I actively enjoy seeking out coomplex technical challenges that develop my probelm solving skills and fuels my drive for continous learning.

My interests lie in machine learning, reinforcement learning, embedded systems and artifical intelligence, particulary within motorosports and the aerosapce sector. My long-term goal is to work in research and development in Formula 1 or at CubeSpace, contributing to areas such as race strategy, aerodynamics, autonomous navigation and performance optimization. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy running, learning about my religeon (Islam) and spending time with family and friends.
